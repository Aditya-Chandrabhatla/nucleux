Where the terms “ventral” (from Latin “towards the belly”) and “dorsal” (from Latin “towards the back”) are used for the torso, the skull is described in terms of “rostral/oral” from Latin “towards the beak [i.e. nose]/mouth) and “occipital/aboral” (from Latin “towards the occipital bone/away from the mouth”). Instead of the terms “medial” (from Latin “towards the middle”) and “lateral” (from Latin “towards the side), the terms “nasal” (from Latin “towards the nose”) and temporal (from Latin “towards the temporal bone”) are used."
