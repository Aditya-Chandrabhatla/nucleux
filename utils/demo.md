# Part 2: BLADDER & PROSTATE

## BLADDER & PROSTATE

### Overview

- The **urinary bladder** is a **hollow, muscular organ** that serves as a reservoir for urine and is located **extraperitoneally** in the pelvis (B,  1486; Sch, 1760; Sabi, 2062).
- **Average capacity** is approximately **500 mL**, though it can extend significantly (up to 1000 mL or more) and rise towards the umbilicus when distended (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- The **bladder dome** is partially covered by **peritoneum**, such that **injury** in this region can lead to **intraperitoneal urine leakage** (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- In the **male**:
    - The **rectum** lies posterior to the bladder.
    - The **prostate** is situated immediately below the bladder neck (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760; Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
- In the **female**:
    - The **uterus** and **vagina** lie posterior to the bladder (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760; Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).

### Arterial Supply

- **Superior vesical artery**: Arises from the **umbilical artery**, a branch of the **internal iliac artery** `(B, Chapter 83, pg 1486; Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760; Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).`
    - Division of the **contralateral superior vesical pedicle** can aid in cephalad mobilization of the bladder during **psoas hitch** procedures (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- **Inferior vesical artery**: Typically from the **anterior division of the internal iliac artery**; in females, it may branch from the **vaginal artery** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- The bladder also has a **rich collateral vascular network**, so ligation or damage to a single branch is rarely detrimental (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).

---

### Venous Drainage

- **Vesical plexuses** on the lateral and inferior surfaces of the bladder drain into the **internal iliac vein** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- These plexuses are continuous with:
    - The **prostatic plexus** in males.
    - The **vaginal plexus** in females (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).

---

### Lymphatics

- Primary lymphatic drainage to the **internal iliac**, **hypogastric**, **obturator**, and **external iliac** lymph nodes (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- **Pelvic lymphadenectomy** for bladder cancer involves **complete clearance** of these nodal groups (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).

---

### Fascia and Ligamentous Supports

- **Posterolateral bladder neck fascia**: Condensations pass forward to join with the prostatic fascia (in males) and must be divided during **cystectomy** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- **Puboprostatic ligaments** (males) and **pubourethral ligaments** (females) are well-defined condensations of **anterior endopelvic fascia**, stretching from the bladder neck/prostate to the pubic periosteum (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486; Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- **Urachus** (median umbilical ligament) and **obliterated hypogastric arteries** (lateral umbilical ligaments) are fibrous cords running to the umbilicus (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- The **pelvic floor** consists predominantly of the **levator ani** group of muscles, covered by endopelvic fascia. The **arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP)** is a key lateral condensation where sutures are placed in **pelvic organ prolapse surgery** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).

### Anatomy & Histology

- The bladder wall has **three principal layers** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486):
    1. **Urothelium** (innermost layer)
        - Serves as a **barrier** against urinary toxins and bacteria.
        - Involved in **afferent signaling** within the bladder.
        - **Defects** in the urothelial lining may contribute to **chronic benign bladder conditions**.
    2. **Lamina propria**
        - Contains a **rich plexus** of vessels, nerves, and lymphatics.
    3. **Detrusor muscle**
        - **Smooth muscle** arranged in a **haphazard** fashion, functioning as a syncytium.
        - Provides the **viscoelastic** properties of the bladder.
- The bladder can be subdivided into (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486):
    - The **body** (area above the ureteric orifices).
    - The **base/trigone** (area below the ureteric orifices).
    - The **bladder neck** (smooth muscle region funneling into the urethra).

### Innervation

- The **lower urinary tract (LUT)** receives **sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic** innervation (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486; Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
    - **Sympathetic**: From the **hypogastric nerve** (T10–L2), primarily facilitating storage.
    - **Parasympathetic**: From the **pelvic splanchnic nerves** (S2–S4), primarily promoting emptying.
    - **Somatic**: Via the **pudendal nerve** (S2–S4) to the **external urethral sphincter**.
- Control of micturition is coordinated by the **pontine micturition center (PMC)**, under higher cortical influence (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).
- The **actions of the spinal and peripheral nerves** on the LUT are summarized in **Table 83.1 [B]** (B, Chapter 83, pg 1486).

### Anatomic Relationships & Surgical Considerations

- **Anteriorly**: The bladder lies behind the **pubic symphysis** and is separated by the **retropubic space (of Retzius)** (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
- **Superiorly**: The dome is covered by **peritoneum** and can be inadvertently **injured** during midline abdominal incisions if not mobilized properly (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
- **Posteriorly**:
    - In males: Adjacent to the **rectum**; **seminal vesicles** and **vas deferens** lie superior and posterior to the prostate (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
    - In females: Adjacent to the **uterus** (superiorly) and the **vagina** (inferiorly) (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
- **Lateral relations** include pelvic side walls, potentially the **sigmoid colon** in the left pelvis, which can **fistulize** to the bladder in cases of diverticulitis or colon cancer (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- **Trauma considerations**:
    - **Pelvic fractures** can disrupt the **posterior urethra** (particularly in men where the **puboprostatic ligaments** suspend the prostate), leading to **pelvic fracture urethral injury** (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).

---

### The Prostate (Male-Specific)

- The **prostate** is a **walnut-shaped gland** located just beneath the bladder neck (Sch 1760; Sabi,2062).
- Surrounded by smooth muscle fibers that can contract and contribute to **bladder outlet obstruction** (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- **Puboprostatic ligaments** suspend the prostate from the pubis (Sch, Chapter 40, pg 1760).
- **Neurovascular supply**:
    - **Arterial** supply: **Inferior vesical arteries** (branches of the internal iliac artery).
    - **Venous** drainage: **Inferior vesical veins** → **internal iliac veins** (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).
- Posteriorly, the prostate is separated from the rectum by **Denonvilliers’ fascia** (Sabi, Chapter 74, pg 2062).

### Controversies or Discrepancies

- **No major conflicting statements** or controversies are explicitly highlighted across the three texts.
